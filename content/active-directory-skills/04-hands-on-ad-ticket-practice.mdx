# Hands-on Active Directory Ticket Practice

Practice common Active Directory support scenarios. Read each ticket, consider the questions, and check your understanding with the provided answers.

## Scenario 1: User Cannot Log In to Domain

**Ticket:**  
User John Doe cannot log in to his domain-joined computer using domain credentials.

### What would you check first? (Select all that apply)

- [ ] Verify the user’s AD account is not locked or disabled  
- [ ] Confirm the computer is connected to the network  
- [ ] Reset the user’s password immediately  
- [ ] Check if the computer is joined to the correct domain  
- [ ] Restart the domain controller  

<details>
<summary>Answers & Explanation</summary>

- ✅ Verify the user’s AD account status (locked/disabled)  
- ✅ Check network connectivity for the client machine  
- ✅ Confirm the computer is correctly joined to the domain  

Resetting password should be done after verifying identity, not immediately. Restarting domain controller is usually unnecessary.

## Scenario 2: Password Reset Request

**Ticket:**  
Jane Smith forgot her password and cannot access corporate resources.

### What is the proper way to handle this?

- [ ] Verify user identity before any reset  
- [ ] Use Active Directory Users and Computers to reset the password  
- [ ] Set a temporary password and force change at next login  
- [ ] Notify the user securely with the new password  

<details>
<summary>Answers & Explanation</summary>

All these steps are important: verify identity first, reset password properly, set a temporary password with mandatory change, and communicate securely.

## Scenario 3: User Needs Access to Shared Folder

**Ticket:**  
Bob reports permission denied when accessing the Finance shared folder.

### How do you troubleshoot?

- [ ] Add Bob to the correct security group with access rights  
- [ ] Manually change permissions on every file in the folder  
- [ ] Recreate Bob’s user account in AD  
- [ ] Confirm Bob is logging in with the right domain account  

<details>
<summary>Answers & Explanation</summary>

- ✅ Add Bob to the proper security group  
- ✅ Confirm login account correctness  

Manually changing every file is inefficient. Recreating the account is not necessary unless corrupted.

- [ ] Assign appropriate permissions on shared drives  
- [ ] Set up email account in Microsoft Exchange or Office 365  
- [ ] Configure user’s computer with domain join and required software

A workstation fails to join the domain and shows an error.

### What would you check?

- [ ] Verify network connectivity and DNS settings on the workstation  
- [ ] Check if the computer account already exists in AD  
- [ ] Confirm the user has permissions to join computers to the domain  
- [ ] Restart the domain controller  

<details>
<summary>Answers & Explanation</summary>

- ✅ Check network and DNS configurations  
- ✅ Remove or reset existing computer accounts if needed  
- ✅ Verify user permissions for domain join operations  

Restarting the domain controller is generally unnecessary.

## Scenario 6: Account Locked Out

**Ticket:**  
User Sarah keeps getting locked out repeatedly.

### What steps should you take to troubleshoot?

- [ ] Check the account lockout status and unlock if necessary  
- [ ] Investigate possible causes like saved passwords on mobile or mapped drives  
- [ ] Check security logs on domain controllers for lockout source  
- [ ] Advise the user to change password and clear cached credentials  

<details>
<summary>Answers & Explanation</summary>

Investigating the root cause prevents repeated lockouts and improves user experience.

## Scenario 7: Group Policy Not Applying

**Ticket:**  
Users report that some group policies are not being applied on their machines.

### How would you diagnose and fix?

- [ ] Run `gpupdate /force` on client machines  
- [ ] Check network connectivity to the domain controller  
- [ ] Verify GPO scope and security filtering  
- [ ] Review Event Viewer logs for Group Policy errors  

<details>
<summary>Answers & Explanation</summary>

This step-by-step approach helps pinpoint the policy application issue.

## Scenario 8: Delegating Permissions

**Ticket:**  
You need to allow a junior admin to reset passwords but restrict access to other AD objects.

### What is the best approach?

- [ ] Use Delegation of Control Wizard in Active Directory Users and Computers  
- [ ] Give full domain admin rights temporarily  
- [ ] Create a custom security group and assign specific permissions  
- [ ] Share your admin credentials  

<details>
<summary>Answers & Explanation</summary>

- ✅ Use Delegation of Control Wizard or assign least privilege permissions via custom groups.  
Sharing credentials or full domain admin rights violates best practices.

</details>

## Scenario 9: Removing a User from Domain

**Ticket:**  
An employee has left the company, and their account needs to be disabled or removed.

### What is the recommended process?

- [ ] Disable the user account immediately  
- [ ] Remove the account after a defined period following company policy  
- [ ] Revoke access to all systems and shared resources  
- [ ] Archive or backup user data as per compliance requirements  

<details>
<summary>Answers & Explanation</summary>

Disabling accounts immediately and then cleaning up later prevents unauthorized access.

</details>

## Scenario 10: DNS Issues Affecting AD

**Ticket:**  
Users report slow logins and intermittent issues connecting to the domain.

### What might be the cause and how to fix?

- [ ] Check DNS server health and configuration  
- [ ] Verify client machines use correct DNS servers  
- [ ] Check domain controller connectivity and replication status  
- [ ] Restart all client machines  

<details>
<summary>Answers & Explanation</summary>

DNS problems are common causes of AD connectivity issues. Ensuring proper DNS setup fixes most problems. Restarting clients helps but isn’t always sufficient.
