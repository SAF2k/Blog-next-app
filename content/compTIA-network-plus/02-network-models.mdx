# 🌐 Network Models

Understanding network models is crucial to grasp how data moves across devices and networks. The most commonly used model is the **OSI (Open Systems Interconnection) model**, which organizes network functions into layered architecture.

## 🧱 The OSI Model (7 Layers)

The OSI model breaks down network communication into 7 layers:

1. **🧍 Application Layer (Layer 7)**  
   Interfaces directly with the user. Protocols: HTTP, FTP, DNS

2. **🪄 Presentation Layer (Layer 6)**  
   Formats data — encryption, compression, encoding.

3. **🎭 Session Layer (Layer 5)**  
   Manages sessions and connections between systems.

4. **🚛 Transport Layer (Layer 4)**  
   Ensures end-to-end delivery. Protocols: TCP, UDP

5. **🏷️ Network Layer (Layer 3)**  
   Handles IP addressing and routing. Protocols: IP, ICMP

6. **📦 Data Link Layer (Layer 2)**  
   Manages MAC addressing and frame delivery.

7. **🧾 Physical Layer (Layer 1)**  
   Deals with raw bits — cables, signals, and transmission mediums.

> 🧠 **Tip:** Think of it as a package delivery system — from preparing the item to shipping and finally handing it to the recipient.

## 🧱 What Are Frames?

A **frame** is a data packet at Layer 2 (Data Link). It includes:
- Destination & source **MAC addresses**
- **Payload** (actual data)
- **Error checking** info (like CRC)

Frames are used in **LAN (Local Area Network)** environments for delivering data across the same network.

---

## 🆔 What is a MAC Address?

A **MAC address** (Media Access Control) is a **unique hardware identifier** assigned to a network interface card (NIC).  
Format: `00:1A:2B:3C:4D:5E` (48-bit address)

- It operates at the **Data Link Layer**
- Used for **local communication**
- Cannot be routed across different networks

> 🔐 Think of MAC as your device’s permanent "name tag" on a local network.

## 🔌 Ports and Services

**Ports** are like virtual doors on your device, allowing it to handle multiple services and applications simultaneously. Each service communicates using a specific **port number** and protocol (TCP or UDP).

Here are some common ports and the services they represent:

- **HTTP (Port 80, TCP):**  
  Used for unencrypted web traffic.

- **HTTPS (Port 443, TCP):**  
  Secure version of HTTP, used for encrypted web traffic.

- **FTP (Port 21, TCP):**  
  Used for transferring files between computers.

- **DNS (Port 53, UDP/TCP):**  
  Resolves domain names to IP addresses.

- **SSH (Port 22, TCP):**  
  Provides secure remote access to devices.

> 🎯 Ports are handled by the **Transport Layer (Layer 4)** and can use either **TCP** (connection-oriented) or **UDP** (connectionless) depending on the service.

## 🌍 IP Address Types

There are two main IP versions: **IPv4** and **IPv6**.

### IPv4
- Format: `192.168.1.1`
- 32-bit address
- ~4.3 billion possible addresses

### IPv6
- Format: `2001:0db8:85a3::8a2e:0370:7334`
- 128-bit address
- Designed to solve IPv4 exhaustion

### IP Address Categories:
- **Public IP** – Routable on the internet
- **Private IP** – Used within LAN (e.g., 192.168.x.x)
- **Static IP** – Manually assigned
- **Dynamic IP** – Assigned via DHCP

## ✅ Summary

By understanding these core networking concepts, you're building the foundation for:
- Diagnosing network issues
- Configuring network devices
- Preparing for deeper networking topics
