# 🌐 IP Protocols – TCP/IP, UDP, IPMC, and IPSec

Internet communication relies on a group of protocols that define how data travels across networks. This guide explores core **IP-based protocols** including **TCP/IP**, **UDP**, **IP Multicast (IPMC)**, and **IPSec** for secure communication.

---

## 📦 TCP/IP Stack Overview

The **TCP/IP model** is a simplified version of the OSI model with 4 layers:

| Layer           | Protocols / Functions                     |
|----------------|--------------------------------------------|
| Application     | HTTP, FTP, DNS, SMTP, SSH, etc.           |
| Transport       | **TCP**, **UDP**                          |
| Internet        | **IP**, ICMP, IGMP                        |
| Network Access  | Ethernet, Wi-Fi, PPP                      |

## 🔀 TCP vs UDP

### ✅ TCP (Transmission Control Protocol)

- Connection-oriented
- Reliable delivery
- 3-way handshake
- Use cases: HTTP, SSH, FTP, Email

### ⚡ UDP (User Datagram Protocol)

- Connectionless
- Fast but unreliable
- Use cases: DNS, VoIP, Video Streaming, Gaming

### 🔁 Quick Comparison

| Feature         | TCP                          | UDP                          |
|----------------|-------------------------------|------------------------------|
| Connection      | Yes                           | No                           |
| Reliability     | Guaranteed delivery           | No guarantees                |
| Overhead        | High                          | Low                          |
| Speed           | Slower                        | Faster                       |

## 📢 IPMC – IP Multicast

**IP Multicast (IPMC)** allows a single sender to deliver data to multiple receivers simultaneously using a group address.

- **Uses Class D IPs**: `224.0.0.0 – 239.255.255.255`
- Efficient for streaming, IPTV, online conferencing
- Common Protocols:
  - **IGMP (Internet Group Management Protocol)** – Used by hosts to join/leave multicast groups
  - **PIM (Protocol Independent Multicast)** – Used by routers to manage multicast traffic

---

## 🔐 IPSec – Internet Protocol Security

**IPSec** is a suite of protocols for securing IP communications at the **Network Layer (Layer 3)**. It offers **encryption, integrity, and authentication**.

---

### 🔧 Modes of IPSec

| Mode            | Description                                                                 |
|----------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Tunnel Mode** | Entire IP packet is encrypted and encapsulated in a new IP header (used between gateways) |
| **Transport Mode** | Only the payload (not the header) is encrypted (used between end devices) |

---

### 🔐 IPSec Protocols

#### ✅ AH – Authentication Header
- Provides **authentication** and **integrity**
- No encryption (data is not hidden)

#### ✅ ESP – Encapsulating Security Payload
- Provides **encryption**, **authentication**, and **integrity**
- Supports both Tunnel and Transport modes

---

### 🔁 IKE – Internet Key Exchange

IKE (v1/v2) is used for **establishing Security Associations (SAs)** between two endpoints.

#### Key Phases:
1. **Phase 1**: Establishes a secure IKE SA (authentication + encryption)
2. **Phase 2**: Negotiates IPSec SAs (AH or ESP parameters)

---

### 🛡️ Security Associations (SAs)

- A **Security Association (SA)** defines the encryption and authentication methods between two peers.
- Each direction (inbound/outbound) has its own SA.
- Identified by:
  - **SPI (Security Parameter Index)**
  - **Destination IP**
  - **Protocol (AH or ESP)**

## 📘 Summary Table

| Protocol | Layer | Purpose                         | Common Use Cases              |
|----------|-------|----------------------------------|-------------------------------|
| TCP      | 4     | Reliable, connection-based       | Web, email, file transfer     |
| UDP      | 4     | Fast, connectionless             | DNS, VoIP, video/gaming       |
| IPMC     | 3     | One-to-many communication        | IPTV, streaming, conferencing |
| IPSec    | 3     | Secure IP communication          | VPNs, secure tunnels          |
| AH       | 3     | Integrity and authentication     | Data origin authentication    |
| ESP      | 3     | Encryption + authentication      | VPN encryption                |
| IKE      | —     | SA negotiation                   | IPSec VPN setup               |

> 🧠 **Pro Tip:** IPSec works at the **IP level**, making it transparent to applications—ideal for **VPNs** and site-to-site tunnels.
