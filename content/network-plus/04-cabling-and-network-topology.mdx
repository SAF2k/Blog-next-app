## 🕸️ Network Topology

**Topology** describes the structure and layout of network connections, both **physical** and **logical**.

### 📌 Common Topologies

| Topology        | Description                                                                 |
|-----------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Point-to-Point  | Direct connection between two devices                                        |
| Star            | All devices connect to a central hub or switch                              |
| Mesh            | Devices are interconnected (full or partial mesh)                           |
| Hybrid          | Combination of two or more topologies                                       |
| Logical         | How data flows regardless of physical layout                                |
| Spine and Leaf  | Used in data centers; scalable and low-latency                              |

## 🏗️ Network Architectures

- **Client-Server**: Centralized server provides services to clients  
- **Peer-to-Peer (P2P)**: Devices share resources equally  
- **Distributed Architecture**: Services are spread across multiple nodes  
- **Data Center Fabric (Spine-Leaf)**: Used in high-speed environments

## 🔌 Coaxial Cables

### 🧵 Structure

- Central copper core  
- Dielectric insulator  
- Shielding (braid or foil)  
- Outer jacket

### 📦 Types

| Type     | Use Case                       |
|----------|--------------------------------|
| `RG-6`   | Cable TV, satellite, broadband |
| `RG-59`  | CCTV, low-frequency video      |
| `RG-11`  | Long-distance, less signal loss|

### 🔗 Connectors

- `BNC` – CCTV, broadcast  
- `F-type` – Cable TV  
- `DAC` (Direct Attach Copper) – High-speed short links in data centers

### ✅ Pros and ❌ Cons

**Advantages**  
- Shielded against EMI  
- Durable and easy to install  

**Disadvantages**  
- Bulky  
- Limited bandwidth  
- Not ideal for modern high-speed networks

## 🧵 Twisted Pair Cables

### ⚡ EMI Protection

- Twisting reduces **Electromagnetic Interference (EMI)**  
- Comes in **Shielded (STP)** and **Unshielded (UTP)** types

### 📏 Distance

- Typical maximum length: `100 meters (328 feet)`

### 🧩 Connectors

- `RJ-45` – Ethernet  
- `RJ-11` – Telephone

### 🧪 Standards

| Category | Speed         | Frequency  | Use                               |
|----------|---------------|------------|-----------------------------------|
| Cat 5    | `100 Mbps`    | `100 MHz`  | Older Ethernet                    |
| Cat 5e   | `1 Gbps`      | `100 MHz`  | Enhanced crosstalk control        |
| Cat 6    | `1–10 Gbps`   | `250 MHz`  | High-speed Ethernet               |
| Cat 6a   | `10 Gbps`     | `500 MHz`  | Shielded for EMI resistance       |
| Cat 7    | `10 Gbps`     | `600 MHz`  | Heavily shielded, less common     |
| Cat 8    | `25–40 Gbps`  | `2000 MHz` | Short runs in data centers        |

## 🧬 Fiber Optic Cables

### 🔍 Types

| Type        | Core Size   | Distance        | Light Source     |
|-------------|-------------|-----------------|------------------|
| Single-Mode | `8–10 µm`   | Long (`>10 km`) | Laser            |
| Multi-Mode  | `50–62.5 µm`| Short (`<2 km`) | LED              |

### 🎨 Cable Colors

| Color     | Mode                          |
|-----------|-------------------------------|
| Yellow    | Single-mode                   |
| Orange    | Multi-mode `OM1/OM2`          |
| Aqua      | Multi-mode `OM3/OM4`          |

### 🔗 Connectors

| Connector | Type        | Description                         |
|-----------|-------------|-------------------------------------|
| ST        | Bayonet     | Push & twist, older installations   |
| SC        | Push-pull   | Square shape, datacenter use       |
| FC        | Threaded    | Industrial use, vibration resistant|
| LC        | Small-form  | Common modern duplex connection    |
| MTRJ      | Compact     | Duplex in a single connector       |

### 🔁 Polishing Types

- `UPC` (Ultra Physical Contact): Blue, low return loss  
- `APC` (Angled Physical Contact): Green, even lower return loss, better for video & long fiber runs

### ⚙️ How Fiber Works

- Light pulses travel through the glass core  
- Internal reflection keeps the light contained  
- Immune to EMI, supports ultra-high-speed over long distances

|---------------|-----------------------|---------------------------------------------|
| Plenum        | Air ducts/ceilings    | Highest fire safety, low-smoke, flame-retardant |
| Riser         | Between floors        | Fire-resistant, not for air ducts           |
| Non-Plenum    | Open spaces           | No fire safety requirements                 |

> 🧯 Always follow **local building codes**. Use **Plenum-rated** cables in air-handling spaces like ceiling voids.
