# ⚡ Ethernet and Networking Essentials

Ethernet is the most widely used technology in **local area networks (LANs)**. It defines how devices communicate over wired networks using cables and frames.

---

## 🌐 What is Ethernet?

Ethernet is a set of standards defined by **IEEE 802.3** that specify how data is formatted and transmitted across a wired LAN.

### 📋 IEEE 802.3 Ethernet Standards

The **IEEE 802.3** standard defines Ethernet—the most widely used wired LAN technology. Over time, several extensions and amendments have been added to support faster speeds, new media types, and advanced features.

Here’s a breakdown of important IEEE 802.3 versions:

### 🧠 Easy Tip:

Think of **IEEE 802.3** as the **main Ethernet umbrella**, and its variants like 802.3i or 802.3u as **children** specializing in different speeds and media.

## 📦 Ethernet Frame Structure

An Ethernet frame is the basic unit of data transmitted. It contains control and payload information.


### 🧩 Frame Fields

- **Preamble (7 bytes)**: Sync bits to help receiver prepare  
- **Start Frame Delimiter (1 byte)**: Marks the start  
- **Destination MAC (6 bytes)**: Who receives the frame  
- **Source MAC (6 bytes)**: Who sent it  
- **Type/Length (2 bytes)**: Type of protocol (IPv4, IPv6, etc.)  
- **Data (46–1500 bytes)**: Actual payload  
- **Pad**: Optional padding if data < 46 bytes  
- **FCS (Frame Check Sequence)**: CRC for error checking

### 📦 Jumbo Frame

- Larger than 1500 bytes (up to 9000 bytes)
- Used in data centers and storage networks

## 🔧 Terminating Twisted Pair Cables

To build or repair cables, you need the right tools and standards.

### 🧰 Tools & Components

- **Crimping Tool** – Attaches connectors to cable ends  
- **Cable Tester** – Checks wiring and signal  
- **RJ-45 Connector (8P8C)** – Common Ethernet plug  
- **RJ-25 Connector** – 6-position connector used for telephony  

### 🎨 Color Coding Standards

- **TIA/EIA-568A**  
- **TIA/EIA-568B** (most common)


### 🔁 Cable Types

| Cable Type         | Usage                          |
|--------------------|--------------------------------|
| Straight-Through   | PC to Switch/Router            |
| Crossover Cable    | PC to PC or Switch to Switch   |
| Rollover           | Cisco console cable (rare)     |

## 🖥️ Networking Applications

| Device         | Function                                                        |
|----------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------|
| Router         | Connects multiple networks, routes traffic                      |
| Firewall       | Controls access to/from networks based on rules                 |
| IDS (Intrusion Detection System) | Detects suspicious activity (passive)         |
| IPS (Intrusion Prevention System)| Detects & blocks attacks (active)            |
| IDPS           | Combined IDS + IPS                                              |
| Proxy Server   | Acts as intermediary between client and internet                |
| Load Balancer  | Distributes traffic among multiple servers                      |
| NAS (Network Attached Storage) | File-level storage on network                  |
| SAN (Storage Area Network)      | Block-level high-speed storage                |

### ❗ False Positive vs False Negative

- **False Positive**: Alert triggered, but no real threat  
- **False Negative**: Threat happened, but no alert (very dangerous)

## 🔀 Switches vs Hubs

| Feature         | Hub                          | Switch                          |
|----------------|-------------------------------|----------------------------------|
| Ports           | Multi-port repeater           | Smart port forwarding            |
| Traffic Method  | Broadcast to all ports        | Sends only to destination MAC    |
| Speed           | Shared bandwidth              | Dedicated per port               |
| Efficiency      | Low (uses CSMA/CD)            | High (MAC table learning)        |



### 🔁 CSMA/CD (used in hubs)

- **Carrier Sense Multiple Access with Collision Detection**
- Devices listen before sending and retry if collision happens


---

## 🔁 Connecting Switches

### 🛠 MDI vs MDI-X

- **MDI (Medium Dependent Interface)** – Used on computers
- **MDI-X (MDI Crossover)** – Used on switches
- Old switches required crossover cables; now most support **Auto-MDI-X**

### 🔁 Switching Loops

When two switches are connected in a loop, it can cause:

- Infinite looping of frames  
- Network flooding (broadcast storm)  
- 🔥 Complete outage

### 🧠 Solution: Spanning Tree Protocol (STP)

- STP prevents loops by **disabling redundant links**
- Uses **BPDU (Bridge Protocol Data Units)** to detect loops
