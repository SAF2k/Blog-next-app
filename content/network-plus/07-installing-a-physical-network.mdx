# 🏗️ Installing a Physical Network

Setting up a reliable network infrastructure involves **planning**, **cable management**, **hardware installation**, and **testing**. Let’s walk through the essential components and processes.

---

## 🧵 Structured Cabling Overview

Structured cabling is a standardized way to lay out a network:

- **📦 Telecom Closet**: Central point that houses networking gear like switches, patch panels, and cable terminations.
- **📏 Horizontal Run**: Cables that run from the telecom closet to wall jacks in work areas.
- **🪢 Patch Panel**: A termination point for horizontal cables, making cable management easier.
- **🔌 Patch Cable**: Short cables connecting patch panels to switches.
- **📘 TIA/EIA Standards**: Guidelines like TIA-568C define cable types, distances, and connector layouts.

## 🔧 Terminating Structured Cables

**110 Punchdown Tool** is used to terminate twisted pair cables (Cat5e, Cat6) into patch panels or keystone jacks.

- **✅ Steps**:
  - Strip the cable jacket
  - Untwist pairs
  - Place wires into slots per color standard (T568A/B)
  - Punch down each wire securely
  - Trim excess

---

## 🏢 Equipment Rooms

- **MDF (Main Distribution Frame)**: Primary location for incoming lines (internet/telecom).
- **IDF (Intermediate Distribution Frame)**: Secondary closet connected to the MDF, usually per floor.
- **Demarcation Point (Demarc)**: Point where the service provider’s responsibility ends and yours begins.
- **Demarc Extension**: Extends the demarc into the building to reach your equipment.
- **Rack Units (U)**: Used to measure equipment height; 1U = 1.75 inches.

---

## 🧯 Alternative Distribution: Fiber Panels

- **Fiber Distribution Panel (FDP)** or **Fiber DP**: Houses and organizes fiber optic terminations.
- Used for high-speed backbone connections between MDF and IDFs.

---

## 🔍 Using a Toner & Probe

Also known as **"Fox and Hound"** tool:

- **Tone Generator**: Sends a signal over a cable.
- **Tone Probe**: Detects the signal for identifying cables among many.

💡 Great for tracking down the other end of an unlabelled cable!

## 🧪 Cable Testing Tools

| Test | Description |
|------|-------------|
| **Wiremap** | Verifies correct pinouts (T568A/B). |
| **Continuity** | Confirms signal can travel end to end. |
| **Distance** | Measures length of cable. |
| **TDR (Time Domain Reflectometer)** | Detects faults in copper cables. |
| **OTDR (Optical Time Domain Reflectometer)** | Same as TDR but for fiber cables. |
| **NEXT (Near-End Crosstalk)** | Measures signal interference near the transmitter. |
| **FEXT (Far-End Crosstalk)** | Measures interference at the far end of the cable. |
| **Crosstalk** | General interference between pairs. |

## 🛠️ Troubleshooting Scenarios

### 📦 Scenario 1: A Workstation Can't Access the Network

**Steps**:
1. Check the physical connection.
2. Use toner & probe to verify cable ends.
3. Test patch cable & wall port with cable tester.
4. Verify switch port is active.

---

### 🌐 Scenario 2: Internet Slowdown on One Floor

**Steps**:
1. Check uplink from IDF to MDF.
2. Use TDR to check for damaged cable.
3. Test for duplex/speed mismatches on switch ports.

---

### 🧱 Scenario 3: No Link Light on PC

**Steps**:
1. Confirm NIC is enabled.
2. Swap patch cable.
3. Use tone generator to test continuity.
4. Re-terminate and retest if needed.

---

### 🔁 Scenario 4: Random Disconnects in Conference Room

**Steps**:
1. Check for excessive NEXT/FEXT.
2. Replace old/cheap patch cables.
3. Confirm structured cabling uses correct category.
4. Test with cable certifier.

---

💡 Pro Tip: **Label everything** and keep detailed documentation—it saves hours later!

---

## ✅ Summary

- Follow **TIA/EIA structured cabling standards**
- Use proper **termination and testing tools**
- Understand **MDF, IDF, demarc**, and fiber alternatives
- Master basic **troubleshooting techniques**
