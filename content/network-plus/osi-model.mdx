# OSI Model

The OSI (Open Systems Interconnection) Model is a conceptual framework used to understand network interactions in 7 layers:

1. **Physical Layer** - Transmits raw bit stream over the physical medium
2. **Data Link Layer** - Provides node-to-node data transfer
3. **Network Layer** - Handles routing and forwarding data
4. **Transport Layer** - Ensures complete data transfer
5. **Session Layer** - Manages connections between computers
6. **Presentation Layer** - Handles encryption, compression, and data translation
7. **Application Layer** - Closest to the end user, provides network services

## Network Communication

Here's a visual representation of the OSI model:

## Key Concepts

- Each layer serves the layer above it
- Data moves down the stack on the sending device and up the stack on the receiving device
- Protocols operate at specific layers to enable communication
- Encapsulation occurs as data moves down the stack
- Decapsulation occurs as data moves up the stack

## Layer Details

### 1. Physical Layer
- Deals with the physical connection between devices
- Defines electrical, mechanical, and functional specifications
- Examples: Ethernet, USB, Bluetooth

### 2. Data Link Layer
- Provides node-to-node data transfer
- Detects and corrects errors in the physical layer
- Examples: Ethernet, Wi-Fi, PPP

### 3. Network Layer
- Handles logical addressing and routing
- Determines the best path for data transfer
- Examples: IP, ICMP, IPsec

### 4. Transport Layer
- Ensures complete data transfer
- Handles flow control and error recovery
- Examples: TCP, UDP

### 5. Session Layer
- Establishes, manages, and terminates connections
- Synchronizes dialogue between devices
- Examples: NetBIOS, RPC

### 6. Presentation Layer
- Translates between application and network formats
- Handles encryption and compression
- Examples: SSL, TLS, MIME

### 7. Application Layer
- Closest to the end user
- Provides network services to applications
- Examples: HTTP, FTP, SMTP, DNS

## Data Flow

1. **Sending Device**:
   - Data moves down the OSI stack
   - Each layer adds its own header (and sometimes trailer)
   - Physical layer converts to bits for transmission

2. **Network**:
   - Routers operate at Layer 3 (Network)
   - Switches operate at Layer 2 (Data Link)
   - Hubs operate at Layer 1 (Physical)

3. **Receiving Device**:
   - Data moves up the OSI stack
   - Each layer removes its corresponding header
   - Application layer presents data to the user

## Common Protocols by Layer

| Layer | Protocol Examples |
|-------|-------------------|
| Application | HTTP, FTP, SMTP, DNS, DHCP |
| Presentation | SSL, TLS, MIME |
| Session | NetBIOS, RPC |
| Transport | TCP, UDP |
| Network | IP, ICMP, IPsec |
| Data Link | Ethernet, Wi-Fi, PPP |
| Physical | USB, Bluetooth, Ethernet cables |

> **Note**: The OSI model is a reference model and not all protocols fit neatly into its layers. The TCP/IP model is more commonly used in practice.
